This chapter has looked at cyber strategies, their necessity, and different strategies 
that can be used when developing them. The key concern in most cyber strategies 
is security. Cyber strategies are essential because they move organizations away 
from assumptions, help centralize decision making about cybersecurity, provide 
details about the tactics employed towards dealing with cybersecurity, give a longterm commitment to security, and simplify the complexities of cybersecurity. The 
chapter has looked at the two main approaches used in writing cyber strategies; the 
attack and defense standpoints.
When written from the attack perspective, cyber strategies focus on the security 
testing techniques that will be used to find and fix security vulnerabilities. When 
written from a defense (Blue Team) perspective, cyber strategies look at how best to 
defend an organization. The chapter has explained the two main defense strategies; 
defense in depth and defense in breadth. Defense in depth focuses on applying 
multiple and redundant security tools, while defense in breadth aims at mitigating 
attacks at the different layers of the OSI model. An organization can opt to use 
either or both of these in the quest to improve its cybersecurity posture
